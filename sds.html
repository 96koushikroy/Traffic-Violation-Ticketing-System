        <h2 id="2.1">2.1 Overall Description</h2>
        <p>
            We will be following the client-server model in our system. Here, the client is responsible for sending requests and receive responses from the server. As this is the most common 
            model when implementing a system so, we opted to go with this one. Along with the Client-Server model we have chosen to follow the Service Oriented Architecture as our Software Design 
            pattern. This is because our server side is solely based on REST data transfer protocol and the client components will act as the services which will use the REST services to do their 
            job.
        </p>
        <p>A basic schematic for the Service Oriented Architechture for our system is given below: </p>
        <img src="./assets/sds/diagrams/SOA.png" class="center-image" alt="">
        <p class="center-text">Fig: A basic block diagram of our Service Oriented Architecture</p>

        <h2 id="2.2">2.2 Framework</h2>
        <p>
            On the client side of our system we will be using <b>React Library</b> along with the <b>Redux Library</b>. In order to develop client end applications using these libraries
            we will be needing Javascript and follow the ES6 coding standard. The reason for choosing React and Redux is because due to easier client side state management.
            Previously it has been seen that managing variables in client end using some vanilla Javascript code can be tedious. So, here come Redux which gives us a centralized
            data store to use them on our client side. And use React to modularise our app into several components and integrate them whereever we need them in our application.
            The codes are usually very easy to maintain. React follows the MVVM software architecture. This architechture has four main blocks: 
            <br><br>
            a) The View which is the UI layer that the user interacts with. 
            <br>
            b) The Model which is the applications data source.
            <br>
            c) The ViewModel which has access to the Model and responsible for the business logic.
            <br>
            d) The ViewController which has access to the ViewModel and handles the user interactions like input etc.
            <br><br>
            <p>A basic schematic of the MVVM architecture is shown below: </p>
            <img src="./assets/sds/diagrams/MVVM.png" class="center-image" alt="">
            <p class="center-text">Fig: MVVM architecture Schematic diagram</p>
            <br><br>
            For redux we work with three different components provided by the library: 
            <br><br>
            a) Store
            <br>
            b) Actions
            <br>
            c) Dispatcher
            <br><br>
            The way these components connect to each other can be represented using the figure below: 
            <br>

            <p class="center-text">Fig: Communication pattern within a React using the Redux Library</p>
        </p>
        <p>On the server side we will be using <b>Express Framework</b> which will be used as the REST API server. This will follow the common Express Application structure.</p>

        <h2 id="2.3">2.3 Database</h2>
        <p>
            For this system we will be using <b>MySQL</b> as our database service. The reason behind choosing this is due to the having relational data in our application. The API server
            will serve data from this database server to the client side. The data will be normalized as much as to the third norm form and will be stored as efficiently as possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In future if the number of users increase significantly so, there will be an increase in server load as well. In order to prevent it on our database server we can use sharding
            technique to distribute the load to other servers as well. For example, we can keep the Police data which has high data request frequency on one server which can be more power than 
            the server where the data for the admin might be kept in.
        </p>



        <h1 id="3.0">3. Data</h1>


        <h2 id="3.1">3.1 Description</h2>
        <p>For the system we will be using MySQL. MySQL is very portable, running on mainframes, PC, laptops, servers, tablets and even smartphones. Writing SQL queries is easy to learn, and SQL databases use an established standard adopted by ANSI & ISO. The use of tables to store data in columns and rows makes it easy to access and manage data. With an RDBMS you can hide sensitive tables and give them their authorization codes, providing a layer of protection for your data SQL is a standardized language well understood by many applications, and many of the alternative database options provide SQL interfaces. The structure of the relational database preserves the integrity of the data and makes it easier to meet compliance regulations. An RDBMS uses indexes to sort data and speed up performance, and supports both desktop and web applications. Relational databases adhere to ACID properties to ensure the reliability of transactions.</p>


        <h2 id="3.2">3.2 ER Diagram</h2>
        <p>The Entity-Relationship Diagram for our Database system will look like the diagram given below:</p>

        <p class="center-text">Fig: ER Diagram of the system.</p>

        <h2 id="3.3">3.3 ORM</h2>
        <p>Write what is an ORM and which ORM we will use in our project and its description.</p>

        <h2 id="3.4">3.4 Model Class Diagram</h2>
        <p>The High Level Model class diagram for our is shown below: </p>
