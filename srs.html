        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        
        <h2>1.1 Purpose</h2>
        <p>The product deals with the Traffic violation; where the traffic police fines the driver with this software and the driver can log into the software and check his fine and due date. This is the initial version of the SRS.And has scopes in government in  traffic control centres.</p>
        
        <h2>1.2 Document Conventions</h2>
        <p>While writing this SRS, IEEE SRS formatting was used. All the six sections in this SRS has a bold font , and are larger than the subsections. Whereas, at the same time, the subsections also have bold fonts and are larger than the description of each subsections.</p>
        
        <h2>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h2>
        <p>The readers that the document is intended for the developes , marketing staff , testers and users(police and general citizen).This SRS contains the descriptions of the users clases and interface, products, design and implementation Constraints, interfaces of the hardware , software and communications, the useclass of different systems and other non functional requirements.</p>
        
        <h2>1.4 Product Scope</h2>
        <p>The software deals with the implementation on a smart phone application which allows the traffic police and general citizens to deal with the process of ticketing after the violation of traffic. The police takes a picture of the lisence and vehicle registration plate by the use of the API , and fines the driver using the app; while the driver can log into the software and input the lisence number to check the due date and the fine they have to pay.The goal is to make the whole system of traffic violation ticketing easier than before , for both the police and driver. The benefits of this system is that it's more accessible, the users(driver) will not need to stand in line for hours to get their schedule to pay the fine; whereas the police will not need to keep tracks of papers and send it to the traffic office everyday to get the cases registered, it will get registered automatically.</p>
        
        <h2>1.5 References</h2>
        <p>&lt;List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.&gt;</p>
        
        <h1>2. Overall Description</h1>
        
        <h2>2.1 Product Perspective</h2>
        <p>&lt;Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.&gt;</p>
        
        <h2>2.2 Product Functions</h2>
        <p>&lt;Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.&gt;</p>
        
        <h2>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h2>
        <p>&lt;Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.&gt;</p>
        
        <h2>2.4 Operating Environment</h2>
        <p>&lt;Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.&gt;</p>
        
        <h2>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h2>
        <p>&lt;Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer&rsquo;s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).&gt;</p>
        
        <h2>2.6 User Documentation</h2>
        <p>&lt;List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.&gt;</p>
        
        <h2>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h2>
        <p>&lt;List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).&gt;</p>

        <h2>4.1 System Feature 1</h2>
        <p>&lt;Don&rsquo;t really say &ldquo;System Feature 1.&rdquo; State the feature name in just a few words.&gt;</p>
        <p>4.1.1 Description and Priority</p>
        <p>&lt;Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).&gt;</p>
        <p>4.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences</p>
        <p>&lt;List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements associated with use cases.&gt;</p>
        <p>4.1.3 Functional Requirements</p>
        <p>&lt;Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case. Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use &ldquo;TBD&rdquo; as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not yet available.&gt;</p>
        <p>&lt;Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a meaningful tag of some kind.&gt;</p>

        <h2 id="performancerequirements">5.1 Performance Requirements</h2>
        <p>We recommend to use a new generation Android phone to ensure smooth and lag free navigation in the mobile app. The camera of the Android phone for the Police should be of better quality to help during Image Processing. The web application should operate without any performance issues in any normal condition. When making API calls from both the Web app and the mobile app the duration of the response depends on the internet connection latency with the API Server. This factor will also affect when the API server will request the database server for data or manipulate data.</p>
        <h2 id="safetyrequirements">5.2 Safety Requirements</h2>
        <p>The information will be encrypted and will be transmitted securely to and from the server. The passwords will be encrypted using salted SHA1 algorithm which will ensure user account security.</p>

        <h2 id="businessrules">5.5 Business Rules</h2>
        <p>The Administrator Accounts will be created by default. The Administrator in this system is responsible for creating the Police Accounts. So, the Police Accounts mainly function after they have been created by the Administrator.
